# Task Board

## Description

In this project I created a kanban task board. The purpose of this project is for the user to have board in which to organize tasks to build a project. The tasks are into task to do, tasks in progress and tasks done. The task cards are draggable, and will turn yellow if the task is due and red if overdue.
